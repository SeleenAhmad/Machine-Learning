# Pasture Biomass Prediction

This project predicts pasture biomass using environmental features. 
Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Key findings:
- NDVI has the strongest linear effect on biomass.
- Rainfall, Soil Moisture, and Temperature are important in non-linear models.
- R² scores: Linear 0.974, RF 0.952, XGB 0.971
